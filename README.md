## Project Description

DrivenData is currently hosting an ongoing competition in the public health sector. While 
vaccines are still under administration logistics with risk factors involved, current data related to 
vaccinations of COVID-19 patients are not yet available. Therefore, this competition aims to 
analyze data from “a different recent major respiratory disease pandemic”, the H1N1 influenza 
virus from spring 2009 (DrivenData). DrivenData pointed out that over 150,000 deaths occurred 
due to this virus also known as the “swine flu”. Since then, a vaccine was developed and became 
publicly available in October 2009. As early of 2010, the current data available in this 
competition is derived from when “the United States conducted the National 2009 H1N1 Flu 
Survey” (DrivenData). 

In this survey, there were questions asking about the respondents’ “social, economic, and 
demographic background” and their “opinions on risks of illness and vaccine effectiveness” 
(DrivenData). Also, questions on whether the respondents have received the vaccines as well. 
DrivenData cited that this data “is provided courtesy of the United States National Center for 
Health Statistics.” 

The current status of this project is ongoing until the deadline of March 31, 2022. The 
prerequisites involve the use of data mining through machine learning algorithms and modeling. 
This project aims to predict the probabilities whether patients are taking the H1N1 and seasonal 
flu vaccines. The motivation is to push for vaccinations, as our customer explains that vaccines 
are “a key public health measure used to fight infectious diseases.”
